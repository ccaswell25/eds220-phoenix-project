# Analyzing Biodiversity Changes in Phoenix, AZ from 2017 to 2020

This is a repository for the final project of the course EDS 220. 

## Explanation

I am going to utilize a dataset incorporating values for a biodiversity intactness index (BII) in order to determine any changes in the BII around the Phoenix subdivision area from 2017 to 2020. Phoenix, Arizona was chosen because, according to the Washington Post, "Maricopa County in the Phoenix metropolitan area was the US county that added the most developed land since 2001".

## Highlights

-Accessing Data from Microsoft Planetary Computer's collections

-Geospatial data exploration and cleaning 

-Mapping spatial data with Basemap

-Calculating biodiversity loss between 2017 and 2020 with numpy

-Creating and customizing a map of biodiversity loss data over three years
